## Non-Restoring Binary Division Algorithm in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the non-restoring binary division algorithm. The algorithm is a method for dividing two binary numbers, typically used in computer arithmetic.

### Overview

The non-restoring binary division algorithm is an iterative process that divides a binary dividend by a binary divisor, producing a quotient and a remainder. Unlike traditional division algorithms, it doesn't rely on restoring the dividend to its original value after each subtraction. Instead, it adjusts the dividend and divisor based on the result of each subtraction step.
